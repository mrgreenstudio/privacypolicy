    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 17, 2026</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Mr.Green Studio</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). We develop and publish applications and games across multiple platforms for a general audience. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information from our users.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Family & Child Safety:</strong> Our products are designed for users of all ages. Because our games are accessible to children, we implement high-standard privacy protections to ensure a safe environment for younger players in compliance with global regulations.
    </div>

    <h2>1. General Information Collection</h2>
    <p>We believe in data minimization. We do not require users to register an account with us to use our applications. Most features are available without providing any personal information.</p>
    
    <h3>A. Optional Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Social Media Sign-In:</strong> We may offer optional integration with services such as Google Play Games. If used, we may access your public profile name to display as your "In-Game Name." This data is used locally and is not stored on our external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Inquiries:</strong> If you contact us via <strong>mrgreenstudio@gmail.com</strong>, we use your email address solely to provide technical support and resolve your request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Automated Data Collection</h3>
    <p>To provide and improve our services, we use third-party tools that collect technical identifiers, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and language settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Anonymous Advertising IDs (such as IDFA or AAID).</li>
        <li><strong>Gameplay Statistics:</strong> Information on level progression, session duration, and technical performance (crash logs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K)</h2>
    <p>Our apps are "Mixed Audience" services. We take additional steps to protect children who use our apps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Behavioral Tracking:</strong> For users identified as children, we disable behavioral advertising and only serve contextual ads.</li>
        <li><strong>Parental Gates:</strong> We implement verification steps to ensure that only adults can access external links, social sign-ins, or support channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Limitation:</strong> We do not collect or store personal information from children for any purpose other than supporting internal operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We utilize industry-standard partners to facilitate our services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unity Ads:</strong> Provides in-game advertisements. In child-directed modes, this service is restricted to contextual advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Analytics:</strong> Helps us understand how users interact with our games to improve difficulty balance and fix bugs.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Cloud Save & Authentication:</strong> Provides anonymous methods to save game progress across sessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Mr.Green Studio <strong>does not sell, rent, or trade</strong> your personal information with third parties. We only share information in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations or valid government requests.</li>
        <li>To protect the rights, property, or safety of Mr.Green Studio, our users, or the public.</li>
        <li>With your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data. Since we do not maintain a central database of user identities, most data (such as local preferences) is deleted when the application is uninstalled from your device.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights and Controls</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights under the GDPR, CCPA, or other local laws. These include the right to access, delete, or limit the processing of your data. As we use anonymous identifiers, users wishing to exercise these rights should contact us with their specific device information.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Information</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
