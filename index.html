		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

		<p>
			Mr.Green Studio ("we," "us," or "our") operates mobile games
			published on the Google Play Store. This Privacy Policy explains how
			we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use
			our games and related services.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have any questions, you may contact us at:
			<a href="mailto:azhagarasan.azhagu@gmail.com"
				>azhagarasan.azhagu@gmail.com</a
			>
		</p>

		<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

		<h3>a) Information You Provide</h3>
		<p>
			When you sign in using Google Play Games authentication, we may
			access:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your Google Play Games profile name</li>
			<li>Your Google Play Games player ID</li>
			<li>
				Basic profile information made available through Google Play
				Games Services
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This information is used for leaderboards and in-game player
			identification.
		</p>

		<h3>b) Automatically Collected Information</h3>
		<p>
			Through integrated services, we may collect certain information
			automatically, including:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Device type, operating system, and version</li>
			<li>App version</li>
			<li>Country or general region</li>
			<li>
				Gameplay activity (such as session length, progress, scores)
			</li>
			<li>Crash reports and performance data</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>c) Cloud Save Data</h3>
		<p>
			We use Unity Cloud Save to store gameplay progress in the cloud.
			This allows you to access your progress across devices when
			authenticated.
		</p>

		<h2>2. Third-Party Services We Use</h2>

		<p>
			Our games use third-party services that may collect information in
			accordance with their own privacy policies:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unity LevelPlay (IronSource mediation)</li>
			<li>Unity Ads</li>
			<li>Google AdMob</li>
			<li>Google Play Games Services</li>
			<li>Unity Authentication</li>
			<li>Unity Analytics</li>
			<li>Firebase Analytics</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			These services may collect device identifiers, advertising
			identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID), usage data, and other
			information to provide analytics, authentication, cloud save
			functionality, and personalized or non-personalized advertising.
		</p>

		<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide and maintain the game</li>
			<li>Authenticate users via Google Play Games</li>
			<li>Display leaderboards and player names</li>
			<li>Save and restore game progress across devices</li>
			<li>Analyze gameplay behavior and engagement</li>
			<li>Improve game design and performance</li>
			<li>Serve advertisements to support free access to the game</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>4. Advertising</h2>
		<p>
			Our games display advertisements through Unity Ads, Unity LevelPlay,
			and Google AdMob. These ad networks may use advertising identifiers
			and device information to provide personalized or contextual ads,
			subject to user consent and regional regulations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Users can manage advertising preferences through their device
			settings, including limiting ad personalization.
		</p>

		<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
		<p>
			We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the services
			described in this policy or as required by law. Cloud save data may
			remain associated with your authenticated account until deleted or
			overwritten.
		</p>

		<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
		<p>
			Our games are not directed toward children under the age required by
			applicable local law for data processing without parental consent.
			If we become aware that we have collected personal information from
			a child without required consent, we will take appropriate steps to
			delete such information.
		</p>

		<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
		<p>
			We rely on secure third-party services (Unity and Google services)
			to store and process data. While we take reasonable steps to protect
			information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is
			completely secure.
		</p>

		<h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
		<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Access your personal data</li>
			<li>Request correction or deletion</li>
			<li>Restrict or object to processing</li>
			<li>Withdraw consent where applicable</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Requests can be sent to
			<a href="mailto:azhagarasan.azhagu@gmail.com"
				>azhagarasan.azhagu@gmail.com</a
			>.
		</p>

		<h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
		<p>
			Because we use global service providers such as Unity and Google,
			your information may be processed in countries outside your own,
			subject to their data protection safeguards.
		</p>

		<h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>
			We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be
			reflected by revising the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the
			game after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
